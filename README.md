## Design Approach & Choices

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Standalone Components** - Used modern Angular standalone components for better tree-shaking and simpler imports
2. **Reactive Forms** - Implemented reactive forms for robust validation and better control
3. **Service-Based Architecture** - Centralized data management through CowService with observable streams
4. **Local Storage Strategy** - Browser storage for data persistence without backend dependency

### UI/UX Design Choices

1. **PrimeNG Integration** - Chose PrimeNG for consistent, professional UI components
2. **Mobile-First Design** - Responsive layouts that work on all device sizes

### Data Management

1. **JSON Dataset** - Initial data loaded from structured JSON file for realistic sample data
2. **Local State Management** - RxJS observables for reactive data flow
3. **Form Validation** - Multi-layer validation including unique ear tag checking
